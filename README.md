# 💪 EnergyX – QA Automation Framework

**EnergyX** is a web application built to streamline session management between gym trainers and clients. While the broader project was developed by a team of 8 (6 developers + 2 QA), this repository focuses specifically on the **Quality Assurance** side of the project – showcasing the automation framework I developed and maintained.

---

## 🧪 QA Automation at a Glance

This repository demonstrates a robust **test automation framework** built using:

- ✅ **Selenium** – UI Automation
- ✅ **RestAssured** – API Testing
- ✅ **TestNG** – Test Execution & Reporting
- ✅ **Cucumber (BDD)** – Behavior-Driven Testing with feature files

I designed and implemented the end-to-end QA strategy, covering both frontend and backend workflows using industry-standard tools.

- 🔗 Integrated API and UI workflows
- 🧪 Authored and maintained over 100 test cases
- 🐞 Identified and logged critical bugs during regression cycles
- 🧼 Maintained a clean, scalable codebase for future contributors
